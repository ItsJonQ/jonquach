Oh wow, what a face lift. Black & pink have always been one of my favourite color combosâ€¦ and I've always wanted a dark site!

There were several reasons why I decided to **revamp** my site:


#### 1. Rebuild it with cool tech stuffs

Over the past year and a half or so, I've been fortunate enough to be able to _invent_ some really cool projects at my [job](https://www.helpscout.net/) (bonus: a lot of them are open source). Some of these projects include:

* [A modular CSS framework](https://developer.helpscout.com/seed/)
* [A React-inspired templating "language" for Jekyll](https://github.com/helpscout/jekyll-spark)
* [A Jekyll unit testing library](https://github.com/helpscout/jekyll-joule)

There are plenty more, but the ones above were used to build this site. (Curious? Check out the [source code](https://github.com/itsjonq/jonquach)).


#### 2. Provide myself with a platform to write

One of my 2017 goals was to write a lot. I failed this goal byâ€¦ a lot. So far, I've published [one blog post](https://www.helpscout.net/blog/style-guide/), and a couple on my [Medium.dot.com](https://medium.com/@itsjonq).

There were **so** many excuses. I didn't have complete well-formed ideasâ€¦ I didn't have the timeâ€¦ I can't englishâ€¦ But, really, at the end of the dayâ€¦

> I don't have an excuse for not writing.

After learning Vim a while back (that month was **hell** BTW), I grew very fond of writing stuff in Markdown. I have oodles of potential posts written in Markdown, stashed away in various folders on my Dropbox account.
