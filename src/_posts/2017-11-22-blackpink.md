Oh wow, talk about a facelift! Black & pink have always been one of my favourite color combos. Not to mention, I've always wanted a dark site!

There were several reasons why I decided to **revamp** my site:


#### 1. Rebuild it with cool tech stuffs ‚ú®

Over the past year and a half or so, I've been fortunate to have the opportunities to _invent_ some really cool projects at my [job](https://www.helpscout.net/) (bonus: a lot of them are open source). Some of these projects include:

* [A modular CSS framework](https://developer.helpscout.com/seed/)
* [A React-inspired templating "language" for Jekyll](https://github.com/helpscout/jekyll-spark)
* [A Jekyll unit testing library](https://github.com/helpscout/jekyll-joule)

There's more, but the ones I mentioned are used to build this site. (Curious? Check out the [source code](https://github.com/itsjonq/jonquach)).


#### 2. Provide myself with a platform to write ‚úçÔ∏è

One of my 2017 goals was to write a lot. I failed this goal by‚Ä¶ a lot. So far, I've published [one blog post](https://www.helpscout.net/blog/style-guide/), and a couple [Medium dot coms](https://medium.com/@itsjonq).

There were **so** many excuses why I didn't write. I didn't have complete well-formed ideas‚Ä¶ I didn't have the time‚Ä¶ I can't English‚Ä¶ But, really, at the end of the day‚Ä¶

> I don't have an excuse for not writing.

I've always been a fan of Jekyll and Markdown. I have oodles of half-formed potential posts written in Markdown stashed away in my Dropbox. I think adding a "Blog" section to my site will encourage me to fully realize those brain farts of mine.


#### 3. #branding ‚úåÔ∏è

Another goal I had this year was to start doing CSS talks / workshops. So far, I've done **one** CSS deep dive talk during my company's Barcelona retreat.

(Apparently I didn't fail at it, and folks really enjoyed it!)

Writing about CSS (and perhaps other code things) will help establish my _#brand_ as an "expert" in the field, which would enable speaking/workshop opportunities (I hope)!

Thanks for reading my first blog blurb and for checking out my new site! **You are awesome**, and I hope you'll stay tuned more posts in the future üöÄ.
