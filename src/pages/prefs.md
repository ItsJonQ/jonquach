A list of workflow or tool preferences that I use on the daily.

<!-- more -->

#### Machine

##### MacBook Pro 2017

The one with the keyboard that dies from dust. Yes, it happened to me.

---

#### Browser

I use all the main ones (Chrome, Firefox, Safari). Google Chrome mostly for development work, and Safari for non-work browsing.

---

#### Coding language(s)

I'm proficient in a several, but my favourites are:

- JavaScript
- CSS

##### TypeScript?

I like it. I've written a [couple of libraries](https://github.com/helpscout?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=&type=&language=typescript) using it. Still getting used to it.

Previously, I used [Flow](https://flow.org/), but found the setup/tooling to be too finicky. TypeScript is far simpler, especially with [Visual Studio Code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).

#### Configurations

Everything is in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/itsjonq/dotfiles)! Everything.

#### Terminal

##### [iTerm 2](https://www.iterm2.com/)

I like how I can save the configurations into my [dotfiles](https://github.com/ItsJonQ/dotfiles/tree/master/iTerm). Not to mention, I've spent many hours fine tuning things to make it look just right.

##### Hyper?

I have it. I try it out every now and then. I find it to be slower compared to iTerm. Plus, my Vim settings/colours clash with the Terminal UI.

##### Shell?

I've been a [ZSH](https://ohmyz.sh/) user since I started doing things in the Terminal. I've recently started using [Spaceship prompt](https://github.com/denysdovhan/spaceship-prompt). I really dig it! ðŸš€

##### Shell Theme?

I use [my own](https://github.com/ItsJonQ/dotfiles/tree/master/base16-shell). Like I said... many hours spent.

#### Code Editor

##### [Visual Studio Code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)

I was a heavy [Vim](https://github.com/ItsJonQ/dotfiles/tree/master/vim) user for several years. My decision to switch over to something... non-Vim... came from the realization that I would often forget how to type normally, without using Vim commands.

My emails, notes, Pull Request descriptions, would have `i`, `:w` or `jjjjjjjjjjjj` all over the place.

##### VS Code Theme?

[My own](https://github.com/itsjonq/dark-refined)! Old habits die hard.

---

#### Prototyping

##### [Code Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/)

This. My goodness, what a brilliant piece of tech this is. I use this all the time for "sketching" my code ideas.

---

#### Illustration Apps

##### [**Procreate**](https://procreate.art/)

An absolutely amazing app for drawing on an iPad with an Apple pencil. This app made me fall in love with digital illustration again.

##### Adobe Creative Cloud

Absolutely hate it - especially Illustrator. I've tried many alternatives, but nothing really compares in terms of features. I've been a user since Photosop 6/7, before the ~~Creative Suite~~ Creative Cloud days. I feel miserable every I have to use Illustrator.

##### [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/)

It's fine. I mean it's good. But for UI work, I prefer designing and prototyping with code.
