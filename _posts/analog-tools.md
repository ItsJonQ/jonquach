Sometimes, the most productive things you can do is to detach from digital and return to the simplicity that is analog. There's profoundness in the level of productivity you can experience with somethings so primitive.

Below is a collection of analog tools that I use every day.

If there was a theme amongst all of the tools I'm listing, it would be **accessibility**. For writing tools, especially analog tools, I define accessibility as **affordable**, **available**, and **unpretentious**. There should be no pressure to use the tool. No regrets to use it to the very end. No second thoughts, except to do what you need to do.

**Note**: There are **no affiliate links**. These product have been meticulously researched, tested, and chosen based on **years of use**.

## Writing tools

### Pens and pencils

**Mechanical pencil** - Bic. It's the quintessential pencil many of us had growing up, and many of us still choose to us. Admittedly, it may not score the absolute highest in all categories. Where these Bics are unbeatable are in their price and availability - that one word, accessibility. You don't need to be precious about them. They'll last a long time. You can replace them. That's what makes them great.

**Lead** - Pentel Ain. Unlike the pencil this lead accompanies (the Bic), this isn't the absolutely cheapest lead you can purchase - but it's close enough. They write smooth and they don't break (unless you're really pushing it). The only tricky thing about them is the lid of the capsule. Twist, don't pull. (It took me a bit to figure that out).

**Eraser** - None. I don't erase (seriously). This is intentional, and is part of my philosophy of honest self expression and ongoing practice of undoing perfectionism. As such, I almost exclusively write with a pen/marker (no white out or white tape). If I make a mistake, I scratch it out. My pages will not be perfect, but they will always be honest - leaving a trail of momentary and mental corrections captured in physical form.

**Ballpoint pen** - Bic Cristal, 1.6mm (Xtra bold). Another Bic! It doesn't get more no-nonsense as the ubiquitous Bic Cristal. A prime example of something that "just works" - not to mention the most affordable and widely available pen in the world. Get the 1.6mm (extra bold) version if you can (slightly more difficult outside the US).

**Gel pen** - Pentel EnerGel 0.7mm. This is my **primary writing tool**. Writes smooth. Zero to 100 the moment the pen tip touches paper. Ink goes on dark, doesn't bleed, and dries fast. Exactly what you're looking for in a gel pen. Pentel offers many variety of EnerGel pens styles (known as "barrels"). Thankfully, they all use the same replacement cartridge. The model I recommend is the EnerGel Kuro (BL437R1) for it's lightweight, uniformed rubber grip, and price (especially in the US).

### Markers

**Dry erase** - Expo Chisel. The chisel's singular tip allows you to write both tiny and big and bold. It's ink goes on dark (enough) and erases really well. For dry-erase board purposes, I only recommend black as coloured markers can leave streaks when erased (on older boards).

**Permanent marker** - Sharpie. The quintessential permanent marker. The very first "indulgent" suggestion to make it on this list - get the **retractable** version. You'll no longer have to fiddle around with a lid again.

**Highlighter/Annotator** - Crayola fine point. Yes. The best highlighter/annotating tool I've ever used is a regular ol' grade school coloured Crayola marker. The tip allows you to make either fine or bold lines. Writes smoothly. Lasts forever. **Doesn't blend/bleed** (as much). Incredibly affordable. Works great.

**Brush/felt tip** - Tombow dual brush pen. As far as writing tools go, this is probably the most expensive one on the list. It's also **not necessary**. I primarily use this to quickly sketch UI designs as well as label things.

## Papers

**Blank paper** - Your standard **8.5x11"**. The most important part is that it needs to be **printer printer**. Other types of paper (e.g. sketchbook paper) may be more fibrous, which results in pen, pencils, and markers "catching" or "bleeding". For what it is, that being a blank sheet of paper, printer paper is the most affordable you can get. As for what brand, honestly, get whatever is on sale. At the moment, I'm working through my stack of printer papers I acquired years ago from Staples.

**Manilla folders** - Your standard **letter sized** beige manilla folder. The most important part is that the folder is letter sized (**not legal sized**). This allows you to seamlessly file away your **8.5x11"** papers. Some situation as the printer papers - get whatever is on sale.

**Notebook** - Michael's Artist's Loft dot journal. I've tried many notebooks. From dollar store notebooks to the expensive Moleskins/Leuchtturm 1917's. None of them come close to the shockingly affordable dot journal from Michael's. There are 3 things that I look for in a notebook. **1. Dot paper. 2. Folds flat. 3. Quality paper**. The Artist's Loft ticks all of these boxes, and then some. The only downside, is that the dimensions are non-standard at 6x8" vs. the traditional 5x8". If you can get over that, I certainly have, then these will serve you very well.

**Sticky notes** - Post-it super sticky, canary yellow. You can't beat 3M when it comes to this type of product. They're so standard, that these types of products are almost always called "post-it notes". Get the "super sticky", 3x3", non-accordion version. They come in a variety of colours, but the most standard is "canary yellow" (An alternative brighter/deeper yellow would be "Electric yellow").

**Tape** - Washi tape. Designed to work on paper. You can stick and peel washi tape from paper without worrying about damaging it. I use these to stick paper today, "bookmark" pages in a notebook, and for labeling. Unfortunately, the one I use has been discontinued (IKEA branded). However, there are a ton of different colours and styles you can find online or at your stationary store. Go with what speaks to your heart. For me, I like plain coloured ones.

## Timers

**Stopwatch** - Robic Oslo 1000W. This is my **primary timer**. Something unexpected that I learned about stopwatches is - all stopwatches have stopwatches, but not all of them have countdown timers. In other words, they all count from zero to something, but not all countdown from something to zero. This particular Robic has a timer. It also has a very clear ergonomic layout where I can **use it without looking at it**. I use it for my custom pomodoro-inspired workflows, which are intervals of 20 minutes. It hangs around my neck during my entire work day.

**Timer** - Kitchen timers. These intentionally cheap "does one thing and does it well" timers can be found in restaurant kitchens all over (they were certainly there for the various kitchens I worked at). They typically come with a magnetic back (which I can't use at my desk) and/or a kick stand, which I can use. I use these to time-box, either work or meetings - those moments when someone "only has 5 minutes!". My kitchen timer complements my stopwatch, allowing me to quickly set arbitrary times in-between my 20 mins intervals.

**Watch** - Casio W800H. After testing over a dozen watches (it's become a hobby of mine), this is the overall watch I'd recommend for **features** and **wear** (it work work on any wrist size). I've tried and tired of the disruptive smartwatch, which battery that I had to babysit. This particular model of Casio ticks all the boxes you'd need for a watch. 10 year battery life. Water resist up to 100m. World time. Stop watch. Timer. And it's best feature, you can **tell the time** the nano-second you look at it. No flicking of the wrist to wake it up or any ceremonial gestures required. Can you believe that?

## Conclusion

These are my everyday analogue tools. They're unpretentious non-nonsense things that **just work**. They've served me well for years, and I'm sure for many years to come. Best of all, I don't need WiFi or a power outlet to use any of them.
