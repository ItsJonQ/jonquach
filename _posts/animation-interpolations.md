In other words‚Ä¶ smoothly transitioning from one thing to another thing! In traditional animation (think the good ol‚Äô hand drawn stuff), this process of transitioning between two key poses (or key frames) is known as [inbetweening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inbetweening#:~:text=Inbetweening%20or%20tweening%20is%20a,smoothly%20into%20the%20second%20image.).

We can use this principle from the wonderful world of animation and apply it to the web interfaces we‚Äôre building to achieve some really amazing effects!

### The Parts

In the context of code, an interpolation is made up of a couple of parts. To achieve a sweet animated interpolation, we have to familiarize with these parts (it‚Äôs not too hard, I promise!)

- **InputValue** ‚Äì The initial (or current) value
- **InputRange** ‚Äì A range for the input value
- **OutputRange** ‚Äì A range for the output (transformed) value

Right, I know the above doesn‚Äôt explain much, but it‚Äôs important to remember these terms. Let‚Äôs go with an example.

Let‚Äôs pretend, we want to transition the background color from red to blue, based on how much the user has scrolled. We only want this effect to apply from the top to about 200px down the page (Fancy, right?!).

The amount scrolled would be the **InputValue**. The top of the page (`0px`) to where we want it to end (`200px`) would be the **InputRange**. Lastly, the red and blue values would be our **OutputRange**.

These values can be visualized like so:

![An illustration visualizing an input value (100), an input range (0 to 200), an output range (a blend of red to blue), and the result (purple).](/assets/posts/animation-interpolations/input-output.png)

If the user has scrolled `100px`, based on our `[0, 200]` range, the resulting color should be a mixture of red and blue.

**That‚Äôs it**! That‚Äôs animation interpolation!

### Examples

Let‚Äôs take our above example of transitioning between red to blue (OutputRange) based on where we position our mouse (Input). If our mouse is on the leftest side of the screen, it should be pure red. If our mouse is the rightest side of the screen, it should be pure blue (InputRange). The interpolation function will **MATH** out the rest, giving us a slick and smooth color transitioning effect:

Color transitioning circles are neat. But how‚Äôs about a more‚Ä¶ practical?‚Ä¶ example.

An interaction that‚Äôs become common in the world of mobile is to smoothly transition text or images as the user scrolls. We can apply the same interpolation technique to achieve just that!

![A Cover image scaling and fading as the content is scrolled.](/assets/posts/animation-interpolations/scroll-interpolation.gif)

[Link to live code example](https://codesandbox.io/s/interpolation-example-vserl?file=/src/App.js)

In the above example, the (Cover) image grows and fades as the user scrolls. The Title text also grows the further down the user scrolls.

Mobile apps use this technique all the time. Now you know how your favourite apps achieve liquid smooth, hyper slick, and super responsive interactions.

### Give it a go

I‚Äôve created a CodeSandbox where you can play around with the red/blue ball. Under the code comment ‚ÄúChange these colors‚Äù, add your own colors to see how you can make the ball magically transition as you move your mouse!

[Click here to check out the CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/interpolation-color-example-hzeyg?file=/src/App.js)

If you‚Äôre interested in seeing how the (gasp) MATH works under the hood, feel free to [peek at the source code](https://github.com/ItsJonQ/g2/blob/master/packages/utils/src/math/interpolate.js). Otherwise, just use the `interpolate()` function from `@wp-g2/utils` and start making things move!

P.S. If you just wanted a no-frills, dependency-free version of the `interpolate()` function code for your project, I‚Äôve prepared a [gist](https://gist.github.com/ItsJonQ/a62257fcbe64e15a8fd0937463fdbc5b) for that.
