I'm a self-taught Designer + Developer, with proficiency in a handful of [coding languages](https://github.com/itsjonq). My absolute favourite is CSS!

> **I love CSS.** It's so wonderfully creative and expressively powerful (and fun).

Having experience in design and development allows me to make an impact in both disciplines. In other words, I make both sides happier and get along better - together.

When I'm not doing overly-ambitious (and possibly silly) things like, I don't know, inventing a way to [write CSS unit tests](https://developer.helpscout.com/seed/css-unit-testing/), or building a [React component library](https://github.com/helpscout/blue) from scratch, I dabble in the world of _illustration_, specifically character/mascot design.

(Fun fact: I started off as a graphic artist.)

(Double fun fact: When I was a kid, I wanted to grow up to be a Disney/Pixar artist.)
